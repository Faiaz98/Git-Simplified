## 1. Introduction to Git

**What is GIt?**

Git is a version control system that helps you manage and track changes to your code. Think of it as a way to keep snapshots of your project at different points in time, allowing you to revert back if needed.

**Why use Git?**

  - Collaboration: Multiple people can work on the same project simultaneously.
  - Version Tracking: Keep track of changes and who made them.
  - Backup: your code is backed up across different locations.

## 2. Setting Up Git

**Installing Git**

- Windows: Download the install from git-scm.com and follow the installation instructions.

- Mac: Install via Homebrew(`brew install git`) or download from git-scm.com.
- Linx: Use your package manager (e.g., `sudo apt-get install git` for Debian-based systems).

**Configuring Git**

After installing, you need to set up your username and email. This information will be associated with your commits.

```sh
git config --global user.name "You Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

## 3. Basic Git Commands

**Initializing a Repository**

To start tracking a project with Git, navigate to your project directory and run:

```sh
git init
```

**Cloning a Repository**

To make a copy of an existing repository:

```sh
git clone <repository-url>
```

**Staging and Committing Changes**

- Staging: Adding changes to the staging area.

```sh
git add <file-name>
```

- Committing: Saving changes to the repository.

```sh
git commit -m "your commit message"
```

**Viewing the Status

To see the current state of your project:

```sh
git status
```

**Viewing the History**

To see the commit history:

```sh
git log
```

## 4. Branching in Git

**Creating a Branch**

Branches allow you to work on different features or fixes separately.

```sh
git branch <branch-name>
```

**Switching Branches**

Move between branches:

```sh
git checkout <branch-name>
```

Creating and Switching in One Command

```sh
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

## 5. Merging and Rebasing

**Merging Branches**

To combine changes from one branch into another:

```sh
git checkout <target-branch>
git merge <source-branch>
```

**Rebasing Branches**

Rebasing replays your changes onto another branch, creating a cleaner project history.

```sh
git checkout <feature-branch>
git rebase <master-branch>
```

## 6. Remote Repositories

**Adding a Remote**

To connect your local repository to a remote one:

```sh
git remote add origin <remote-url>
```

**Pushing Changes**

To send your commits to the remote repository:

```sh
git push origin <branch-name>
```

**Pulling Changes**

To fetch and merge changes from the remote repository:

```sh
git pull origin <branch-name>
```

## 7. Advanced Git Commands

**Stashing Changes**

To temporarily save changes without committing:

```sh
git stash
```

**Applying Stashed Changes**

To reapply stashed changes:

```sh
git stash apply
```

**Resolving Conflicts**

When Git can't automatically merge changes, you'll need to resolve conflicts manually. Conflicted files will include markers showing the differences between the branches.

## 8. Best Practices

- Commit Often: Small, frequent commits make it easier to track changes.
- Write Meaningful Commit Messages: Describe what changes you've made and why.
- Use Branches: Keep your main branch clean by developing features and fixes in separate branches.

## 9. Common Issues and Troubleshooting

**Undoing Changes**

To undo changes in your working directory:

```sh
git checkout -- <file-name>
```

To revert a commit:

```sh
git revert <commit-id>
```

**Dealing with Merge Conflicts**

When you get a merge conflict, edit the conflicted files to resolve differences, then:

```sh
git add <resolved-file>
git commit
```
