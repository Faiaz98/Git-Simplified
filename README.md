## 1. Introduction to Git

**What is GIt?**

Git is a version control system that helps you manage and track changes to your code. Think of it as way to keep snapshots of your project at different points in time, allowing you to revert back if needed.

**Why use Git?**

  - Collaboration: Multiple people can work on the same project simultaneously.
  - Version Tracking: Keep track of changes and who made them.
  - Backup: your code is backed up across different locations.

## 2. Setting Up Git

**Installing Git**

- Windows: Download the install from git-scm.com and follow the installation instructions.

- Mac: Install via Homebrew(`brew install git`) or download from git-scm.com.
- Linx: Use you package manager (e.g., `sudo apt-get install git` for Debian-based systems).

**Configuring Git**

After installing, you need to set up your username and email. This information will be associated with your commits.

```sh
git config --global user.name "You Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```
